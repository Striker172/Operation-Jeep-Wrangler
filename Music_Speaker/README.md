# Music_Speaker

A Particle library for Music_Speaker

# The actual music for the library is from this Github Repo, they did all of the work defining the frequency and such: 
# https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs. 
# The Player's actual code was partly made from this Repo
# https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs/issues/33
# This was a player that came with non blocking code and was extremely useful for figuring how it actual worked. The player method is based on that person's code. 

The rest of the code was done by me with modification to make it work for this project aka the class constructor and setup. So huge credit for those people who made it.
