Description: 
Our IoT project comprises two separate devices that work together. The first device is a controller that is designed to remotely control the other photon device actions. 
The second device is a car that is equipped with features such as color-shifting headlights and a horn that will notify people of its presence if need be and even play music.
These devices will work simultaneously with the power of the cloud services that Photon provides. We also ended up using a 9 volt battery to supply power to the motors. There is also a dip switch that can make our device switch to only take input from the cloud. The dip switch we also used alos had music that we could play through the horn and as well as through the cloud playing through the car. The cloud connectivity that we had allowed us to control the headligs, the horn/music, and as well as the car itself through thr website.
